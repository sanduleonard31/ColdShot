# Cold Shot â€” Personal Site

This repository contains the static front-end for the "Cold Shot" personal site. It's a lightweight HTML/CSS/JS site with content JSON files and assets under the `assets/` and `source/` folders.

Quick notes:
- Pages: `index.html`, `home.html`, `archive.html`, `masters.html`, `settings.html`.
- Source files and components are under `source/` (HTML partials, JS components, styles).
- Content is stored in `content.json` and date-based sections folders (e.g. `08.2025/`, `10.2025/`).
